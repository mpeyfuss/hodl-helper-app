# HODL Helper App
The app for HODL Helper - Believe in something and just HODL.

## About
HODL Helper aims to help people lock away tokens they truly believe so they aren't tempted into trading.

One of the best moves people can make when investing is to "buy and hold". This is especially true in the stock market, but I also believe that it can be valid in crypto, even if that hasn't been fully proven yet.

Locking tokens away helps keep people true to the strategy, as humans are easily tempted by charts in general. The goal of this app is to lock tokens away without completely stopping users from accessing the funds in case they need them.

## Current Status
The current dApp is written in NextJS. It's a framework I'm comfortable with and has large support, especially in web3 and it uses React.

It's meant to be a pretty simple MVP. I've built the smart contract to be useable as a simple backend, however, more complex ideas I have like trending tokens will require a backend in the future. For now, that's something I planning on working on, but want to get this out in front of the community to get feedback.

## Design
I'm not a designer, but I'd like to think that I've learned a few things over the last few years of building. This doesn't mean that the design is good, but hopefully it's not bad either. 

In my head, HODL Helper has always been yellow. Not sure why, maybe it's cause I think the logo should be similar to the Walmart smiley face stickers they give out. I'm open to changing this around and would love input from the community.

Please feel free to roast my designs! I need the help :)
